Target: 1. Set up a model to predict whether a person makes over 50k a year.
        2. Display useful information with any visulization library. (Matplotlib?)
        
Features:
--continuous(6): age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week
--discrete(8): workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country
  
Performace:  accuracy, AUC curve, confusion matrix

Models:

1. Set up Logic Regression and Random Foreset models as benchmark.
2. Set up Deep Learning models and optimise the architecture.
3. Further new or senior models if possible.
