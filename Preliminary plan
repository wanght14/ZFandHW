Target: 1. Set up a model to predict whether a person makes over 50k a year.
        2. Display useful information with any visualization library (Matplotlib?).
        
Features:
--continuous(6): age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week
--discrete(8): workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country
  
Performace:  accuracy, AUC curve, confusion matrix

Models: Logic regression, Random forest, Deep nerual networks and other feasible methods

Implementation:

1. Data cleaning (Pandas?) and data visualization (Matplotlib?).
2. Set up LR and RF models as benchmark (Sklearn, pytorch or tensorflow?).
3. Set up DNN models and optimise the architecture (Sklearn, pytorch or tensorflow?).
4. Further new or senior models if possible.
